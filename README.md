# Traffic-Control-Object-Detection
Given an image, whether a photograph or a frame from a video, in this project we have implemented Object Detection, specifically vehicle detection. The project has been implemented in Python making use of OpenCV and NumPy Libraries and taking classes from the COCO Dataset. The detected vehicles have been bounded in a rectangular box and their class i.e., their type has been added to the image. A total count of each type of vehicle in the image has also been determined. The project uses the concept of deep learning, and neural networking. The project has various applications in the real world, like toll booth management, parking plaza systems, security and identification, to analyse density of objects for road construction etc.
